The classics of. Repository Open in Codesandbox Introduction into core features Dipole core consists three main classes: Observable , Computed and Reaction . All the classes can be constructed via non-capitalized factory functions observable , computed and reaction correspondingly without new keyword. Observable Observables are containers that contain some value and allow some other dependent objects to get notified when the value changes. import { observable } from 'dipole' const counter = observable(0) counter.get() // returns 0 counter.set(1) // sets observable value to 1 Using makeObservable helper it's easy to convert observable properties on some object into convenient getters and setters: const counter = makeObservable({ count: observable(0) }) counter.count // return 0 counter.count = 5 // sets observable to 5 Or the same with classes: class Counter { count = observable(0) constructor() { makeObservable(this) } } const counter = new Counter() Only object's own properties are converted . (You may also have noticed that code from Examples section uses observable.prop instead of observable for defining fields - in fact, it's exactly the same function, the only difference is its Typescript definition : type of observable.prop(T) is T , while type of observable(T) is Observable<T> ) There are also few helper functions designed to work with makeObservable : fromGetter and notify . Computed Computed values are values that are derived from other observables and computeds with some pure function. The function should not contain any side-effects other than returning a value and depend only on observable/computed values. The result of computed is cached until any of its dependencies are changed. import { computed } from 'dipole' const double = computed(() => { console.log('Computing double value...') return counter.get() * 2 }) double.get() // prints 'Computing double value...' and returns 2 double.get() // doesn't print and returns 2 - the result is cached! counter.set(2) // update computed dependency double.get() // prints 'Computing double value...' and returns 4 // another way to invalidate an observable is to call `.notify()` // this is useful when observable contains a complex object like Array or Map counter.notify() double.get() // prints 'Computing double value...' and returns 4 again Of course computed values can contain any kind of conditions/loops that dynamically reference to different observables, this will be correctly handled by dipole: const cond = observable(true) const a = observable('a') const b = observable('b') const result = computed(() => { console.log('Computing result...') return cond.get() ? a.get() : b.get() }) result.get() // prints 'Computing result' and returns 'a' // now `result` depends on `cond` and `a` values cond.set(false) result.get() // prints 'Computing result' and returns 'b' // now `result` depends on `cond` and `b` values a.set('aa') // `result` doesn't depend on `a`, nothing will happen result.get() // nothing changed for `result`, just returns 'b' again b.set('bb') // change `result` dependency result.get() // prints 'Computing result' and returns 'bb' There are some intuitive limitations for computed values: 1) They can't recursively refer to itself: const recur = computed(() => recur.get() + 1) recur.get() // throws 'Trying to get computed value while in computing state' 2) They must not change any observable or trigger any side-effects: const badBoy = computed(() => counter.set(0)) badBoy.get() // throws `Can't change observable value inside of computed` Reaction and transaction Reactions are automatic actions that are triggered on dependent observable/computed changes const a = observable(1) const b = observable(2) const sum = computed(() => a.get() + b.get()) const r = reaction(() => { console.log(`Sum of ${a.get()} and ${b.get()} is ${sum.get()}`) }) r.run() // first run should be triggered manually // prints 'Sum of 1 and 2 is 3' a.set(3) // prints 'Sum of 3 and 2 is 5' b.set(4) // prints 'Sum of 3 and 4 is 7' Last lines show that reaction reacts to each change in its dependencies, synchronously. But what if we want to batch changes and run reaction only once after both a and b changes? Here's the answer: transaction : Transaction // `tx` stands for `transaction` import { tx } from 'dipole' tx(() => { a.set(2) // doesn't react b.set(3) // doesn't react too }) // prints 'Sum 2 and 3 is 5' right after transaction end Action and untracked transaction Actions are functions wrapped in transaction. But there is also one significant difference with plain transactions: actions are untracked . This means that any access to any observable or computed fields performed in action won't be tracked by calling function/reaction. This makes actions building pieces for your application - they could be safely called from any place with predictable consequences: import { action } from 'dipole' const addBoth = action((amount) => { a.set(a.get() + amount) b.set(b.get() + amount) }) // invoke action, all arguments and `this` are passed to inner function addBoth(3) // prints 'Sum of 5 and 6 is 11' once Sometimes inplace untracked transactions are usefull too, so there is utx function for this ( utx stands for Untracked TX): class UserModel { isLoading = observable.prop(false); user = observanle.prop(null); error = observable.prop(null); constructor() { makeObservable(this); } // async functions can't be wrapped in `action`, so using `utx` inplace for observable changes async fetchUser() { utx(() => this.isLoading = true); try { const response = await userService.getData(); utx(() => { this.user = response.user; this.isLoading = false; }); } catch (err) { utx(() => { this.error = err; this.isLoading = false; }) } } } utx function also returns the result of its body execution, so it could be used for peeking at some observables/computed values without getting them tracked by underlying reaction/computed: const person = observable('Alice') const government = reaction(() => { const who = utx(() => person.get()); console.log(`${who} is caught!`); }) government.run(); // Alice is caught! but... person.set('Anonymous') // you get it! :) Reactions can be destroyed, so they will not run after that: r.destroy() a.set(4) // doesn't react to the change anymore Nested reactions Since dipole version 2.2.0 reactions that get created while another reaction is executed become children of the parent reaction. Child reactions get automatically destroyed when parent is destroyed or run. Why is this needed? This behaviour enables building hierarchical constructs, where one reaction (say, router) creates another reaction (say, view or page), and changes that trigger router reaction automatically destroy view reaction, so all related resources could be freed. For more context, see this issue . In case you want intentially create a reaction without parent, just do it inside untracked transaction: const free = utx(() => reaction(() => { ...reaction body... })); Advanced reaction usage Advanced reaction usage with reaction context and manager argument: const delayed = reaction( () => console.log(counter.get()), // reaction body null, // reaction context (`this` for reaction body) () => setTimeout(() => delayed.run(), 1000) // reaction manager, should manage to run `.run()` method somehow ) delayed.run() // prints '3' counter.set(4) // prints '4' after 1 second Limitations Please avoid changing reaction's dependencies inside reaction body - this will cause reaction running in an infinite loop: const forever = reaction(() => counter.set(counter.get() + 1)) forever.run() // never ends Reaction utilities There are two utility functions that can help is some cases: when() accepts a condition function and body, so body gets executed in untracked transaction each time condition is true: const cond = observable(false); const r = when( () => cond.get(), () => { console.log(\"Condition is true\") } ); cond.set(true); // prints \"Condition is true\" cond.set(false); // doesn't print once() works the same as when() except the fact it runs only once when condition is set to true : const cond = observable(false); const r = once( () => cond.get(), () => { console.log(\"Condition is true\") } ); cond.set(true); // prints \"Condition is true\" cond.set(false); // doesn't print cond.set(true); // doesn't print too In all cases, when() and once() will run body if condition is initially set to true . Returned object is Reaction instance, so it could be destroyed or run again as usual reaction. API Observable new Observable(value) observable(value) Creates an Observable instance containing the value Observable.prototype.get() Get the value from Observable instance and track the usage of the observable into underlying Computed or Reaction Observable.prototype.set(value) Sets a new value of Observable , notifying dependent Computed / Reaction about the change Observable.prototype.notify() Notify dependent Computed / Reaction about a change in underlying Observable 's value. Useful after changing mutable objects like Arrays, Maps or any other objects. Computed new Computed(computer) computed(computer) Create a Computed instance with computer function used for computed value calculations. computer must be a pure function and not change/notify any observable - only .get() calls to other Observable / Computed values are prohibited. Computed.prototype.get() Get result of computer function invocation. The result is computed at the moment of invocation, if it's the first time the method is called or some of computed dependencies are changed. Otherwise, cached value is returned. Also it tracks the usage of the computed into underlying Computed or Reaction Reaction new Reaction(reactor [, context [, manager]]) reaction(reactor [, context [, manager]]) Creates a Reaction instance with reactor function in its core, with optional context and manager arguments. context is this argument for reactor param, defaults to undefined . manager is a function that should somehow schedule/manage invocation of .run() method of the object on reaction's dependency change. See dipole-react bindings for example of manager usage. Reaction.prototype.run(...arguments) Runs reaction's reactor function with this set to context and passes all method's arguments to it. Reaction body runs in implicit transaction, so there is no need to use transactions inside it. Reaction.prototype.destroy() Destroys reaction, so it doesn't react to any changes anymore before next manual invocation of .run() method. transaction tx(() => { ...transaction body... }) Execute transaction body function in transaction block. The body function is invoked without any arguments or this . action action((...args) => { ...action body... }) Returns a function wrapped in untracked transaction. Calls to the resulting function will pass all arguments and this to action body. Since action body is untracked, .get() calls or getters to any observables/computed values won't introduce new dependencies when called inside action body (but it's not true for transaction). utx utx(() => { ...transaction body with result... }) Execute transaction body in untracked transaction and return execution result. Because transaction is untracked, .get() calls or getters to any observables/computed values won't introduce new dependencies when called inside of it. makeObservable makeObservable(object) Iterates through own enumerable properties and replaces them with getters/setters for each instanse of Observable/Computed classes. Only properties are processed, so if there are already some getters on the object, they won't be invoked. Mutates the object and returns it as result. fromGetter fromGetter(() => { ...some getter call to observable/computed... }) Returns an observable/computed object hidden under some getter called in the body function. Returns undefined if the function didn't call any getters/ .get() methods. If there is more than one getter call in the body function, only result for the latest one returned. notify notify(() => { ...some getter calls on observables... }) Calls .notify() method on all observables, which getters were executed in body function.
